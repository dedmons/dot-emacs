About
-----
A cozy fireplace for emacs.

Installation
------------

Download ``fireplace.el`` and place it somewhere in your ``.emacs.d`` directory, say in ``.emacs.d/fireplace/``.
Compile the file using ``M-x byte-compile-file``.
Put ``(load "~/.emacs.d/fireplace/fireplace")`` in your init file (``.emacs``).
Note that there is a significant performance difference between the compiled and non-compiled fireplace.


You can start the fire using ``M-x fireplace``.
The fireplace will try to fill the current window with a new buffer.
To put the fire out use ``M-x fireplace-off`` or hotkey ``q``.


========================= ================================
